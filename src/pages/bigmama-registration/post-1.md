Coach Big Mama… Does A Body Good!

Coach Michelle Braithwaite, (aka: Big Mama) is the owner and founder of Big Mama’s House of Pain. With over five years experience in the fitness industry, Michelle has done it all.

Michelle is a proud mother of two amazing children and has been an athlete her entire life. She started playing sports at the age of nine, and continues to involve herself in the community through volunteering, organizing charity events and playing slow pitch.

On January 2, 2015, Michelle had her first Grand Mal Seizure. Two weeks later, she experienced another Grand Mal Seizure and that left her with brain damage. She gained 110lbs during this
time. She was told by her doctor that her kidneys and liver were failing and that if she didn’t make an immediate health change that she would die. It wasn’t until this moment that Michelle knew she needed to lose weight in order to live.

<br>

Michelle decided to take her health and weight seriously five years ago on May 15, 2016, and joined a workout program. She ended up losing 141lbs in five years through this HIIT workout
program. After working out continuously, she went from being a gym member, to working the front desk, to a full-time Coach and Sales Manager. It was here that Michelle’s love for fitness truly came to be. When Michelle was a gym manager, her location won the Community Votes Winnipeg Award for the 2021 Gold Gym Winner, during the height of the COVID.

<br>

Unfortunately, a year after that, the pandemic made it hard to scale sales.

<br>

With a heavy heart the gym was forced to shut the doors, leaving her and her community at a loss. Rather than sitting around and collecting unemployment, Michelle decided to take a leap of faith and open up her own business, BMHOP. In a short three-month span, she was able to relocate the members of that gym to a new facility. It was most important to Michelle to keep her community members together. BMHOP is not your typical gym. We are a family and a supportive community. We provide 30- minute HIIT classes through Brickhouse Gym. Our workouts are geared towards any fitness level, ages 13 and up. Here at BMHOP, we believe that fitness does not have any excuses or vacation. We as a community help keep each other accountable every single day.

<br>

Coach Michelle says, “I want to help people live happier, healthier lifestyles and educate people on fitness. If I can do it, so can you.” SO. If you’re ready to take that next step and begin your fitness journey, we welcome you to Big Mama’s House of Pain.

<br>

BMHOP: YOU VS YOU.

<br>

Practice makes progression. Progression makes perfection.
